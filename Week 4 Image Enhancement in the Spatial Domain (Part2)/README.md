# Image Enhancement in the Spatial Domain (Part2)

More Image Enhancement in the Spatial Domain

- **Histogram Processing**: Image quuality can be enhanced by *Histogram Equalization*. Whether the image is dark or has low-contrast, we can equalize the histogram of pixel value by distribute them on the histogram. [[Link]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization)
- **Enhancement Using Arithmetic/Logic Operations**: Image can be considered as an array of numbers that we can do operations on it. 
  - **Image addition**
  - **Image subtraction**
  - **Logic operation**: Specific part of image can be selected by applying mask on them and use operation AND/OR.
- **Image Averaging**: A noise-reduction technique that calculates the average value of each pixel in a set of images.
