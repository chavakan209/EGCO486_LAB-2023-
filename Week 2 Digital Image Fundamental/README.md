# Week 2 Digital Image Fundamental

This week is about Digital image Fundamental.

The lab shows examples of 

- **False contouring**: A result of reducing the gray-level resolution of a digitized image (Quantization problem). 
- **Checkerboard pattern**: A result of reducing the spatial resolution of a digitized image (Sampling problem).
